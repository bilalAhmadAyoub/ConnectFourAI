# ConnectFourAI
A Desktop application of the classic Connect Four board game, where players can try their luck against an AI opponent. Implemented using a depth-limited minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a transposition table. The AI considers ten moves in advance, effectively sets and counters traps, and has proven to be a resilient opponent against seasoned Connect Four players. 

## An example of how the UI appears:
